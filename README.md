Portfolio 2 Submission. Option 2.1.

This is a simple exercise application. When the user loads the home screen it welcomes them and gives them two options to view either arm exercises or leg exercises. When the user clicks one it takes them to another screen where it lists the exercise for that area of focus along with reps and sets. There is a button that takes them back to the home screen so they can access the other screen.
